This repository contains multiple projects related to Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), including both reproductions of classic algorithms and personal research implementations. Through these projects, I aim to build a complete learning path from basic reinforcement learning to multi-agent reinforcement learning.

## Learning Path and Project Connections

The projects in this repository form a complete learning path from basic reinforcement learning to multi-agent reinforcement learning:

1. **Basic Theory and Algorithms** (RL_Learning-main): Master the mathematical foundations and basic algorithms of reinforcement learning
2. **Basic Algorithm Implementation** (Hands-on RL): Implement basic reinforcement learning algorithms
3. **Multi-Agent Extensions** (MADDPG_Continous): Extend single-agent algorithms to multi-agent scenarios

## Project Structure

### I. RL_Learning-main: Reproduction of Basic Reinforcement Learning Code

Reproduction of Professor Shiyu Zhao's reinforcement learning course code from Westlake University, including value iteration, policy iteration, Monte Carlo, temporal difference, DQN, Reinforce, and other algorithm implementations. This part is the best starting point for understanding basic reinforcement learning algorithms.

### II. Hands-on Reinforcement Learning

Reproduction and expansion of the code from the book "Hands-on Reinforcement Learning", with the ultimate goal of extending to MADDPG. This part records my systematic learning of reinforcement learning, from basic to advanced algorithm implementation.

#### Implemented Algorithms
- DQN (Deep Q-Network)
- Policy Gradient (REINFORCE)
- Actor-Critic
- DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient)

#### Learning Path
This section demonstrates the learning path from basic DQN to DDPG, and then to MADDPG, laying the foundation for understanding multi-agent reinforcement learning.

### III. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Implementation
> **This project is specially optimized for Predator-Prey pursuit games!** Built on a modified `PettingZoo MPE` environment, it provides a comprehensive multi-agent cooperative and competitive environment suitable for pursuit control, swarm intelligence, and strategy game research.

After mastering basic reinforcement learning algorithms, we naturally think: how can these methods be extended to scenarios where multiple agents learn simultaneously? Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the key technology to solve this problem.

#### 3.1 MADDPG_Continous: Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm

Personal implementation of the MADDPG algorithm based on the latest version of the MPE environment in PettingZoo, supporting multi-agent cooperation and competition in continuous action spaces.
