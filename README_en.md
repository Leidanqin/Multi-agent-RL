### II. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Implementation

After mastering basic reinforcement learning algorithms, we naturally think: how can these methods be extended to scenarios where multiple agents learn simultaneously? Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is the key technology to solve this problem. Below are my two main implementations in the MARL field.
